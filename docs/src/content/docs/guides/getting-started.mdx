## Installation

<Steps>

1. To install Solid, run the following command

   ```bash
   dart pub global activate solid_generator
   ```

2. Then, add the dependencies needed by running this command in your Flutter project

   ```bash
   flutter pub add solid_annotations flutter_solidart 
   ```
   
   [flutter_solidart](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_solidart) is the state management library used by Solid, but you don't have to learn how to use it, Solid will generate all the boilerplate code for you.

3. I'd also suggest installing the [very_good_analysis](https://pub.dev/packages/very_good_analysis) package to get amazing linting rules for your Flutter project.

   ```bash
   flutter pub add dev:very_good_analysis
   ```
   
   Then in your `analysis_options.yaml` file, add the following line

   ```yaml title="analysis_options.yaml"
   include: package:very_good_analysis/very_good_analysis.yaml
   ```

   This is an example of an `analysis_options.yaml` file

   ```yaml title="analysis_options.yaml"
   include: package:very_good_analysis/analysis_options.yaml
   analyzer:
     errors:
       must_be_immutable: ignore # Ignore immutability rule, because Solid generates immutable classes but you write mutable ones
   linter:
     rules:
       public_member_api_docs: false # Disable documentation requirement for public members
   ```
</Steps>

## How it works

The code you write is the source of truth, and Solid generates the boilerplate code needed to make the app working.

There is an important difference between writing normal Flutter code and writing Solid code:
In Flutter, the `lib` folder is the source of truth, while in Solid, the `source` folder is the source of truth.

<Aside>
The `source` folder contains the code you write, and Solid generates the `lib` folder based on it.
</Aside>

You never have to edit the `lib` folder manually, as it is generated by Solid.

I decided not to use the `lib` folder directly because I don't want to touch the original files, but I wanted to keep the same naming and structure, without adding complexity to you like `part` files or similar.

I wanted to use `lib` as the input folder, but `flutter build` doesn't allow building (as far as I know) an app from a different folder than `lib`.

In addition, Solid is not a common generator because it transpiles your existing code to an optimized version of it.

## Usage

```sh
Usage: solid [options]

-s, --source          Source directory to read from
                      (defaults to "source")
-o, --output          Output directory to write to
                      (defaults to "lib")
-w, --[no-]watch      Watch for file changes and auto-regenerate
-c, --[no-]clean      Deletes the build cache. The next build will be a full build.
-v, --[no-]verbose    Verbose output
-h, --[no-]help       Show this help message

Examples:
  solid                    # Basic transpilation
  solid --watch            # Watch mode
  solid --clean --verbose  # Clean build with verbose output
```

> The next chapters expect that you have setup Solid in your Flutter project, created the `source` folder and started the command with `solid --watch` to auto-generate the `lib` folder on file changes.
